## About 4 Hour Ventures

4 hour venture is an event format designed to validate ideas and built web-prototypes in just 4 hours. It’s like Startup Weekend but on steroids. 

***About 4 Hour Ventures***

It doesn’t have to take forever to get some validation or a prototype for your idea. At least we don’t think so! That’s why we created the 4 Hour Ventures organization. We provide an event framework that allows you, your colleagues, your co-workers or just people from the local community to accelerate ideas and test assumptions in only 4 hours.

***Methodology***

Fundamentally 4 Hour Ventures is based on Lean Startup methodology. Therefore the participants will get the opportunity to do quick prototyping, work with customer validation, marked research and business model canvas.

***The format***

The format is pretty simple – we gather a group of people (15-20) with different competences and let them work in teams on projects of their choice. You can come with an idea or without – doesn’t matter. The workshop will be facilitated by an experienced facilitator to make everything run smooth.
